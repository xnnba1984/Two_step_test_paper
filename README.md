This repository contains the analysis and simulation code that produces all empirical results in the manuscript ""Xi N.M., Wang L. (2025). A Two-Step Test for Zero-Inflated Biomarkers in Early-Phase Clinical Trials." Each script is independent of the ```twostepAKSA``` R package and no external functions are required. The preprint can be downloaded [here]().
